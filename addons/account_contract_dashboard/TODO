V calculate expansion mrr & churned mrr
V filtered_contract_template_ids should not be as a class variable
V graph behind boxes
V revenue churn
V graph : last day
V revenue churn
V table by plan on js --> too slow
V filter by contract_template and not by product_template
V make demo data to tests algorithms
	--> if next invoice has 10 days, churn during 10 days and then churn reup
V monthly revenu on an invoice on 1 month ?

	--> Unit if measure in "Customers" in plan table ?
	--> Same filters : also on products ?

- for more filtering, button on /stat to report/invoice analysis with groupby default on category
- use @MAT field to caculate nrr
? do not use negative mrr (asset, nothing to do with revenue recognition)
? arpu --> a Monthly rpu ?
? net revenue
	--> either billing (all invoice)
	--> either non-recurring + prorata of monthly recurrent*nb_months


# OPTIMIZATIONS

V main dashboard : one by one in JS
- main dashboard : one jsonrpc for value + graph
- optimize call to db --> filter after and compute graph from the end
	--> to optimize call : --log-level=debug-sql
- Monthly Recurring Revenue Growth graph with mousemove event
- Filter : readgroup
