	--> Unit if measure in "Customers" in plan table ?
	--> Same filters : also on products ?

- Filter : readgroup
- calculate expansion mrr & churned mrr
- use @MAT field to caculate nrr
V filtered_contract_template_ids should not be as a class variable
V graph behind boxes

? do not use negative mrr (asset, nothing to do with revenue recognition)
? arpu --> a Monthly rpu ?
? net revenue
	--> either billing (all invoice)
	--> either non-recurring + prorata of monthly recurrent*nb_months
V revenue churn
- graph : last day

V revenue churn : 
	- comment se passe concrètement un downgrade, comment est-ce que ca se reflète sur les invoice lines ?
	- pareil pour les cancellations ?
		--> ex: invoice de 1200€ pour 12 mois (mrr : 100€) - date : 01/01/2014 --> 01/01/2015
			si le type annule le 01/09/2015, elle disparait ?
			si le type downgrade ?
		--> only for renewal ?

- table by plan on js --> too slow
- filter by contract_template and not by product_template
- for more filtering, button on /stat to report/invoice analysis with groupby default on category
V make demo data to tests algorithms
	--> if next invoice has 10 days, churn during 10 days and then churn reup
- to optimize call : --log-level=debug-sql
- monthly revenu on an invoice on 1 month ?


# OPTIMIZATIONS

V main dashboard : one by one in JS
- main dashboard : one jsonrpc for value + graph
- optimize call to db --> filter after and compute graph from the end
- Monthly Recurring Revenue Growth graph with mousemove event
