F- [revenue recognition] revenue recognition category should be selected somewhere (either on product template, either on customer invoice)

F- [invoice creation] account linked to revenue recognition has to be different if asset or revenue recognition
F- ["Asset/Revenue recognition category" creation]
	- wrong labels for accounts

		- Account Fields for Asset
			- Asset Account: account_asset_id

        self.prorata = True
